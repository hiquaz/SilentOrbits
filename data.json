  "reasoning_content": "User wrote: \"cosmos%202251%20deb\". That looks like a command-line style search? They might be searching for \"cosmos 2251 deb\". Honestly, \"cosmos 2251 deb\" could refer to \"Cosmos 2251 debris\"? This is likely about a space debris event. Cosmos 2251 was a Russian satellite that broke up in 2009, causing a large amount of space debris. \"deb\" might be the abbreviation for \"debris\". The user might be searching for a dataset or a search query. They might want info about Cosmos 2251 debris. maybe they want to find risk assessment, count of debris, size distribution. The user just typed \"cosmos%202251%20deb\" which is a URL encoded string: \"cosmos 2251 deb\". They might want the data or potential hazards. It's not a question explicitly. The instruction: respond appropriately and consider user intent. They might want to know about Cosmos 2251 debris. I'll explain what Cosmos 2251 broke up. Provide information on debris field, size distribution, risk to other satellites, maybe recommended actions. Also mention a NASA database or ESA's space debris website or the NASA-JPL Solar System Dynamics TLE data. Provide resources. They might want to know how many pieces of debris were generated by Cosmos 2251. According to sources, about 1,600 pieces of debris >1 cm, sometimes over 3,000 including small ones, maybe more. Provide link to the NSSDCA or the ESA's Space Debris Office. Provide the data about the debris density. Provide context on how risk mitigation and tracking works. Provide some offline or online resources like the N2YO website to view TLEs.\n\nAlso, we can provide an overview of how the debris field changed after fragmentation. And mention that Cosmos 2251 is in a certain orbit: Low Earth orbit (LEO). Explain the implications, perhaps damage to ISS etc. And maybe mention that in 2008 there was close approach between the ISS and a piece that stemmed from Cosmos 2251, but the ISS's Attitude Control thrusters prevented a collision. Provide citations.\n\nAlso mention that the user might be looking for a dataset to study the debris distribution. Provide a reference to the \"Space-Track.org\" website for TLEs. Also mention that the Cosmos 2251 event is often used in space debris modeling. Provide references to JPL's \"Colombo WT\" series. Use format: bullet list. Also mention the event's telemetry. Provide short summary of timeline. The user apparently typed \"cosmos%202251%20deb\" maybe captured from search query. So we respond with the information. We'll want to keep it friendly, engaged, provide info. Also maybe ask clarifying question: Are they looking for specific details? We'll respond.",
